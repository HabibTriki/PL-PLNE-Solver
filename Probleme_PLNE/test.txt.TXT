**Problem :

Let's start by formulating a basic linear programming (LP) problem for a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using Python and Gurobi. For simplicity, we'll assume a scenario where you need to determine the optimal routes for a set of vehicles to minimize total distance traveled, subject to constraints on vehicle capacity and the maximum number of customers per route.

Assumptions
There is one depot and multiple customers.
Each vehicle has the same capacity.
Each customer must be visited exactly once by exactly one vehicle.
The total distance traveled by each vehicle should be minimized.
